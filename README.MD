Adware Definition Files
=======================

This repository collects Adware Definition Files (ADF) for [SavingThrow](https://github.com/sheagcraig/SavingThrow) which have been tested and are generally considered to be safe and effectively designed.

A number have just been added thanks to Owen Pragel (@opragel) which have unfinished lines commented out. For the purposes of looking for potential adware on a machine, these commented out lines will not interfere; the ADF may just not be finding everything there is to find.

To use, feel free to fork, or download and self-host with your own modifications for your own organization.

Contributions are welcome! (Use Pull Requests to add or correct an ADF).
